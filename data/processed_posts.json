Using advanced sensors and high resolution, it can detect a fire as small as 5x5 meters, which wasn't possible before. It updates every 20 minutes, comparing fresh imagery against historical data and factoring in local conditions like infrastructure and weather. Then it beams updates to emergency teams on the ground so they can react in real time. \n\nFireSat builds on our work using AI to map the boundaries of large wildfires and get people accurate information in 27 countries (including during the LA fires earlier this year.) In the next few weeks we\u2019ll start testing, and the system will be fully operational over the next few years.\n\nThis is a huge effort with many partners including Muon Space, Earth Fire Alliance, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.
